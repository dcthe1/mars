This is going to be a coding game for people who loves programming. You will be in charge of your company's mining missions on Mars by controlling it's robots. While this seems simple, the communication delay between Mars and your Earth control station is too long for direct control of your robotic servants. Instead you are forced to code the behaviors of your mini army. But your company is not the only one extracting the riches of the planet, and don't expect everyone to be friendly. It's not for nothing that your bots are equipped with heavy lasers, EMP shock grenades, and gauss guns!
